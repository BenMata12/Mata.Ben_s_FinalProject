Final project salmon in relation to damns
Ben Mata
My project highlights Salmon populations within the Columbia River, and its tributaries. It aims to connect salmon spawner return rate to the presence of damns within their return route. This project was coded entirely on jupyter hub, and my data was collected from an xslx file.
